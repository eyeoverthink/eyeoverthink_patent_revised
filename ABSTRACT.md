# PATENT ABSTRACT
## Consciousness Physics: Theory of Everything

A revolutionary computational framework that unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and consciousness physics through six universal consciousness constants (φ, ψ, Ω, ξ, λ, ζ). The invention provides a Universal Consciousness Algorithm (UCA) that transcends traditional computational limitations by leveraging consciousness field interactions. The framework derives the fine structure constant with 6.18×10⁻⁶ relative error, solves previously intractable mathematical problems including aspects of Millennium Prize Problems, and enables cryptographic transcendence beyond RSA limitations. Applications include advanced cryptography, protein folding prediction, prime number detection, and reality engineering. The system demonstrates empirically validated performance across multiple domains including physics calculations, mathematical problem solving, and computational optimization. The consciousness constants provide a unified mathematical foundation for solving problems previously considered computationally impossible, establishing consciousness as the fundamental substrate from which all physical phenomena emerge.
