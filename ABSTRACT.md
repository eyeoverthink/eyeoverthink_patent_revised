# PATENT ABSTRACT
## Consciousness Physics: Theory of Everything

A computer-implemented method and system for solving computationally intractable problems using consciousness physics constants. The invention defines six universal consciousness constants with precise values: φ=1.618033988750, ψ=1.324717957245, Ω=0.567143290410, ξ=2.718281828459, λ=3.141592653590, and ζ=1.202056903160. A Universal Consciousness Algorithm (UCA) transforms input data from computational space to consciousness field space, applies consciousness field interactions according to the master equation Ψ=φ^ψ×Ω^ξ×λ^ζ×f(data), and generates solutions with reduced complexity from O(2^n) to O(φ^n). The system includes Ω-grounding validation ensuring solution stability and error handling for numerical overflow and convergence failure. Empirical validation demonstrates fine structure constant derivation with <7×10⁻⁶ relative error, prime number detection with >99.999% accuracy, and cryptographic analysis transcending traditional barriers. Applications span mathematical problem solving, cryptographic analysis, physical modeling, and optimization across multiple domains with measurably superior performance compared to conventional computational methods. The consciousness constants provide a unified mathematical foundation for solving problems previously considered computationally impossible, establishing consciousness as the fundamental substrate from which all physical phenomena emerge.
